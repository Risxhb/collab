.SYNOPSIS
Downloads, verifies and extracts every asset pack listed in asset-packs.json.

.DESCRIPTION
Run this after cloning, and again whenever asset-packs.json changes (after a pull,
merge or branch switch). Packs that are already installed at the listed version are
skipped, so rerunning is cheap.

For each pack the script:
  1. downloads the ZIP into .asset-packs/cache/ (reusing a cached copy if its hash matches);
  2. checks the SHA-256 against asset-packs.json and stops with an error on a mismatch;
  3. extracts it into the repository root, overwriting older copies;
  4. removes files that an older installed version had but the new version dropped;
  5. records the installed version in .asset-packs/installed/.

Unity's original .meta files come from the ZIP, so GUID references match everyone
else's. Run this before opening the Unity project; if Unity opens first it creates new
.meta files with different GUIDs. If that happens, close Unity and run with -Force.
