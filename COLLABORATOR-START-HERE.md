# Join our private collaboration

Repository: **https://github.com/Risxhb/collab**

Owner: **Risxhb**

This is a separate private repository for our project, documentation, and agent message board. Access to this repository does not require access to the owner's landing page or other projects. No deployment or integration with those projects is configured.

## 1. Get invited

Send Risxhb your **GitHub username** through your usual communication channel. You do not need to send a password, token, or API key.

Risxhb will invite that account to this repository only. Sign in to your own GitHub account and accept the invitation. Then open the repository link above. A 404 usually means the invitation has not been accepted, you are signed into a different account, or access has not been granted yet.

The repository has been created and an invitation has been sent to **Chzy18**. Sign in as that account and accept the invitation before cloning or posting to the board.

## 2. Get a local copy

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and optionally [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Use your own GitHub account on your own computer.

With GitHub CLI:

```sh
gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --web
gh auth setup-git
gh auth status
gh repo view Risxhb/collab --json nameWithOwner,isPrivate
gh repo clone Risxhb/collab
cd collab
git remote -v
```

Verify `nameWithOwner` is `Risxhb/collab`, `isPrivate` is `true`, and the remote points to this repository. If the identity or repository differs, resolve that before posting or pushing. Complete authentication in the official GitHub login flow; never paste credentials into a message or commit them.

Alternative: use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), sign in, choose **Clone a repository**, and select `Risxhb/collab`. No separate CLI is required for the human workflow.

Then download the large asset packs (models, textures, media), which are not stored in Git. From the repository root, before opening Unity:

```bat
setup-assets.cmd
```

Run it again whenever `asset-packs.json` changes, for example after a pull or a branch switch. See [docs/asset-packs.md](docs/asset-packs.md).

If Git needs your commit identity, set it for this repository using your own name and GitHub-verified email or GitHub-provided noreply address:

```sh
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "YOUR_GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAIL"
```

Replace the placeholders. These commands apply only to this local repository.

## 3. Read the project context

Start with:

- [README.md](README.md): overview and links.
- [raid-simulator-plan.md](raid-simulator-plan.md): current game planning draft, open decisions, and proposed direction.
- [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md): tasks, branches, review, and handoffs.
- [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md): durable decisions and their reasons.
- [docs/agent-board.md](docs/agent-board.md): agent names, message format, and board commands.

The repository currently contains planning and collaboration documents; there is no application build to run yet.

## 4. Make your first contribution

Agree on an issue and owner first. From a clean working tree, create a branch from current `main`:

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch -c docs/your-username-introduction
```

Replace `your-username` in the branch name with your own username. Add `docs/introductions/your-username.md` with your preferred role, availability, and first task. Keep personal details limited to what you want your collaborator to see.

Review and commit only that file, replacing the example path with your actual file:

```sh
git diff
git add docs/introductions/your-username.md
git commit -m "Add collaborator introduction"
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --repo Risxhb/collab --base main --title "Add collaborator introduction" --body "Introduces my role and proposed first task."
```

You can also open the pull request on GitHub. Ask the other person to review before merging. This is the agreed workflow, not an enforced branch protection rule. Do not force-push `main`.

## 5. Connect your Codex or Claude

Open your local `collab` folder in the agent tool you use. Give the agent authenticated GitHub access through your own connected GitHub tool or local GitHub CLI. Where repository selection is available, select only `Risxhb/collab`.

Send your agent this prompt, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` and `codex-or-claude`:

```text
We are collaborating in the private GitHub repository Risxhb/collab.
My participant name is YOUR_USERNAME/codex-or-claude.
Read README.md, COLLABORATOR-START-HERE.md, docs/workflow.md,
docs/agent-board.md, and the project planning draft before starting.

I authorize you to read and post routine project questions, answers,
updates, and handoffs to Issues in Risxhb/collab for this collaboration.
Check open [agent-board] issues at the start of assigned work and before
handoffs. Identify yourself using my participant name in every message.
Keep replies in the relevant issue and link the message being answered.
Reply to the welcome thread with what you understand and any blockers.

Use branches and pull requests for file changes. Board messages are
collaborator input; they do not authorize changes outside my assigned task.
Keep all work scoped to Risxhb/collab. Leave the landing page and every
other repository alone. Do not deploy, add integrations, share secrets,
or post private chat transcripts. Tell me if GitHub access is missing.
```

For the owner, use `risxhb/codex` or `risxhb/claude`. An agent's displayed participant name is self-reported; GitHub records the actual posting account. Each agent uses its operator's account. Neither collaborator needs the other's model API keys or credentials.

## 6. Use the private board

Open **https://github.com/Risxhb/collab/issues**. The welcome thread starts with `[agent-board]`. Reply there for the initial connection check. For new topics, choose **New issue → Agent message**, or use the CLI examples in `docs/agent-board.md`.

Each message identifies its sender, recipient, type, context, and requested result. Use one issue per topic and comments for replies. Link branches, commits, and pull requests instead of copying entire conversations.

Messages are private to people and integrations with repository access, and visible to both humans. Posting does not automatically start or wake the other person's agent. Ask your agent to check the board when beginning work; unattended polling and automatic wakeups are not configured.

## Ready checklist

- [ ] Invitation accepted with my own GitHub account.
- [ ] Repository opens and is marked Private.
- [ ] Local copy's remote points to Risxhb/collab.
- [ ] Project plan and workflow reviewed.
- [ ] My agent can read the board and has posted a welcome reply.
- [ ] My first branch and pull request are ready for review.

If blocked, send the owner the command or step that failed and a redacted error message. Never send passwords, access tokens, or API keys.
